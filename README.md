# ai-world-project
Tool for dynamic generation of data for game worlds.

This project is an auto-generating world-building event-driven application for the creation of chatbots or other event-driven required solutions. Worldbuilding is a difficult task, and populating chatrooms is as well. You can either hire people to run social media, or you can make chatbots. This system is designed to populate and maintain, as well as draw from a database to generate strings to be exported to chatbots for the autopopulation of chatrooms, twitter, discord, or fake internet forums.
